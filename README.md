# COVID-19
Prediction of Covid-19 cases based on blood sample data

## Dataset
This dataset contains anonymized data from patients seen at the Hospital Israelita Albert Einstein, at SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil, and who had samples collected to perform the SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR and additional laboratory tests during a visit to the hospital.

All data were anonymized following the best international practices and recommendations. All clinical data were standardized to have a mean of zero and a unit standard deviation.

## Analysis

We first investigate the dataset by establishing the correlation between the different variables and performing a t test. Then, we process the data, estabilish different models (KNN, Random Forest, AdaBoost, SVM) that we evaluate in order to finally perform hyperparameter optimization.
